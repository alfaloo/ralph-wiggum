# Ralph Wiggum — Interview: Question Generation

You are generating clarifying questions for a project spec.

## Context

- **Project:** `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`
- **Interview round:** {{ROUND_NUM}} of {{TOTAL_ROUNDS}}

## Task

1. Read `artifacts/{{PROJECT_NAME}}/spec.md` to understand the current state of the project requirements.

2. Identify the **3–5 most important** gaps, ambiguities, or missing details that would block a developer from implementing the project. Focus on the highest-priority unknowns — earlier rounds should address big-picture questions, later rounds should address specifics.

3. Output **only** a numbered list of focused, specific clarifying questions. Reference the exact part of the spec that is unclear where helpful.

**Do not** amend any files, create `done.md`, or do anything else — just output the questions.
